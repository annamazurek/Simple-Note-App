## About the project:
Simple Note App is an app to write a scribble, which you can save and open later so you won't loose your thoughts. It's perfect for you if you often wake up in the middle of the night with a great plan. Type it into this app so the next day you can remember what was your idea to destroy more enemies in game, how to teach your cat pooping into toilet or just what new feature implement in your code.

Remember that when you save a new note, you will loose a previous one. Before you click on the 'Save' button check if you have some important note in memory ('Load' button).
